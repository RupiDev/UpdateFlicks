# UpdateFlicks
This project is an updated version of Flicks. This is second week for Flicks. I had to create a new Repository because I started the project over


# Project 2 - *UpdateFlicks*

**UpdateFlick** is a movies app displaying box office and top rental DVDs using [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **17** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can view movie details by tapping on a cell.
- [x] User can select from a tab bar for either **Now Playing** or **Top Rated** movies.
- [x] Customize the selection effect of the cell.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete.
- [x] Customize the navigation bar.
- [x] Implemented Search Bar
- [x] All images fade in as they are loading
- [x] Customization of the UI. Made the UI match with grey and black colors

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Added another tab with upcoming movies and added all the icons with the tab view
- [x] Implemented Motion Sensor with APP. So in addition of switching views when the user taps the UISwitchCell, the user can switch switch by shaking the app.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I would definately like to talk about implementing the tab view
2. Also I would like to talk about implementing the lower and high resolution apps

## Notes

The challanges with this app was trying to figure out the motion sensor shaking app. I really wanted to implement that feature. 
Another thing I had difficulty was implementing the tab view because it was done all through programming instead of using the XCode
interface. So it was something new and I learned something new
